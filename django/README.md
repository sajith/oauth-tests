# Django

(These are notes to self and may not be useful for anyone else.)

The code so far is straight from the official Django tutorial.

To run, on Debian:

  sudo apt-get install python3-django
  ./manage.py migrate
  ./manage.py runserver

To test out the RESTful stuff, also do:

  sudo apt-get install python3-djangorestframework
